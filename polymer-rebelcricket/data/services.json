In this arena every project is truly unique and though we invite your phone call for discussion, it is crucial for us to examine physical items and assess needed ink formulations and jigs prior to providing a true estimate. Design and fabrication of jigs may be required so additional lead time is appreciated. We stock ink formulations for plexi, metal, glass and a variety of flexible films which means you can have your logo printed on just about anything.    Make an appointment today.",
